# OpenCV 4 with Python
## Introduction to Deep Learning
Nowadays, deep learning is the most popular and fastest growing area in machine learning. Deep
learning has been surpassing traditional approaches for machine learning applications since
2012. This is the reason why a lot of deep learning architectures have been applied to a great number
of fields, including computer vision. Common applications of deep learning include automatic speech
recognition, image recognition, visual art processing, natural language processing, recommendation
systems, bioinformatics, and image restoration. Most modern deep learning architectures are based on
an artificial neural network, and the deep in deep learning refers to the number of layers of the
architecture.
In this chapter, you will be introduced to deep learning by looking at the differences with traditional
machine learning approaches, which were covered in the Chapter 10, Machine Learning with OpenCV
. Additionally, you will see some of the common deep learning architectures applied to both image
classification and object detection. Finally, two deep learning Python libraries (TensorFlow and
Keras) will be introduced.
More specifically, the following topics will be tackled in this chapter:

   Deep learning overview for computer vision tasks
   
   Deep learning in OpenCV
   
   TensorFlow library
   
   Keras library
   
In this chapter, you will be introduced to the world of deep learning with OpenCV, and also with
some deep learning Python libraries (TensorFlow and Keras). In Chapter 13, Mobile and Web
Computer Vision with Python and OpenCV, you will learn how to create computer vision and deep
learning web applications.
## Technical requirements
The technical requirements are listed here:

Python and OpenCV

Python-specific IDE

NumPy and Matplotlib packages

Git client

TensorFlow library (see the following section on how to install TensorFlow)
